# AI-friendly browser automation

## Purpose

This specification owns the reliability contract for entry-level `thirtyfour`
examples, selector guidance, the AI/LLM quickstart, task-oriented recipes, and
translation guidance, and coding-agent guidance that humans and agents are
likely to copy. It also defines the browser-test runner, portable failure
artifacts, and the interaction-helper design boundary; it does not define the
later page-snapshot work ordered in
[`todo.md`](../todo.md).

## Requirements

- **AI-AUTO-001 (confirmed):** Entry-level examples that manage a local browser
  must use `WebDriver::managed`; an example specifically teaching an external
  Selenium endpoint may use `WebDriver::new`. Every flow must explicitly await
  `driver.quit()` and propagate its error when no earlier flow error takes
  precedence.
- **AI-AUTO-002 (confirmed):** Normal element lookup in entry-level examples
  must use `WebDriver::query` or `WebElement::query`, so lookup polls for the
  required page state instead of making a one-shot request.
- **AI-AUTO-003 (confirmed):** Queries for important user-facing elements must
  include a human-readable description for timeout diagnostics.
- **AI-AUTO-004 (confirmed):** A query must use `single()` when exactly one
  match is part of the example's page contract, and `first()` only when
  first-match behavior is intentional.
- **AI-AUTO-005 (confirmed):** The entry-level documentation must describe
  `find()` and `find_all()` as lower-level, one-shot WebDriver operations rather
  than the normal automation path.
- **AI-AUTO-006 (observed):** The repository-root README is a symlink to the
  crate README, which directs readers to the `tokio_async` runnable example.
- **AI-AUTO-007 (confirmed):** The README, crate-level rustdoc, mdBook
  walkthrough, and matching runnable examples must stay behaviorally aligned.
- **AI-SEL-001 (confirmed):** Documentation must prefer stable, app-owned
  `data-testid` hooks through `By::Testid` when the application under test can
  provide them.
- **AI-SEL-002 (confirmed):** Selector guidance must recommend stable semantic
  CSS selectors when no test ID exists, and XPath only when CSS cannot
  reasonably express the target.
- **AI-SEL-003 (confirmed):** Visible-text matching is appropriate when the
  displayed copy is part of the behavior under test. It must not be presented
  as the default way to identify controls because copy, localization, and
  duplicate labels can make it brittle.
- **AI-SEL-004 (confirmed):** Examples against third-party sites must use
  selectors the real page exposes rather than pretending app-owned test hooks
  exist. The surrounding guidance must distinguish this constraint from the
  preferred practice for applications the reader controls.
- **AI-STYLE-001 (confirmed):** The mdBook must provide one concise checklist
  of reliability rules suitable for pasting into coding-agent instructions.
- **AI-STYLE-002 (confirmed):** The checklist must cover session setup and
  cleanup, query semantics and diagnostics, stable selectors, readiness waits,
  query scoping and components, session concurrency, and protocol-specific
  isolation and feature gates.
- **AI-STYLE-003 (confirmed):** Every major checklist rule must link to the
  deeper documentation that defines its behavior and must not claim that a
  planned API, such as the managed test harness, already exists.
- **AI-STYLE-004 (confirmed):** The checklist must be linked directly from the
  getting-started learning path.
- **AI-QS-001 (confirmed):** The mdBook must provide one compact AI/LLM
  quickstart with minimal dependencies and a starter test using
  `WebDriver::managed`, `query()`, readable descriptions, explicit readiness
  conditions, a user-visible outcome, and explicit session cleanup.
- **AI-QS-002 (confirmed):** The starter test must prefer app-owned test IDs,
  scoped queries, and a cleanup shape that still attempts `quit()` after the
  test body fails. A sample URL that is not runnable must be marked `no_run`.
- **AI-QS-003 (confirmed):** The quickstart must give direct selector,
  readiness, scoping, outcome, cleanup, and concurrency rules, while linking
  to the canonical reliability checklist rather than duplicating it.
- **AI-QS-004 (confirmed):** The quickstart must link to the query, waiting,
  component, manager, CDP, and BiDi guides and be part of the mdBook
  getting-started navigation.
- **AI-REC-001 (confirmed):** The mdBook must provide a dedicated recipes
  section with copyable, task-shaped examples for login, search, HTML modal or
  dialog interaction, iframes, shadow DOM, file uploads, screenshots on
  failure, table or list assertions, browser and driver logs, a simple CDP
  network or cache command, and a basic BiDi event subscription.
- **AI-REC-002 (confirmed):** Every recipe must use `WebDriver::managed` unless
  an external WebDriver service is essential, use polling queries and element
  waits for readiness, describe important queries, prefer stable selectors,
  and explicitly attempt session cleanup.
- **AI-REC-003 (confirmed):** Each recipe must be short enough to copy and
  adapt, use cardinality that matches the intended page contract, and assert a
  user-visible or protocol-visible outcome instead of treating a successful
  click as sufficient evidence.
- **AI-REC-004 (confirmed):** Recipes that depend on an application, local
  browser, filesystem fixture, or optional protocol feature must be marked
  `no_run` and state the required setup or feature gate. Recipes must not use a
  fixed sleep for page readiness.
- **AI-REC-005 (confirmed):** Protocol-specific recipes must keep portable
  WebDriver flow separate from Chromium-only CDP and opt-in BiDi behavior, and
  link to the deeper owning guides rather than duplicating their full API
  references.
- **AI-TRANS-001 (confirmed):** The mdBook must map Selenium element lookup,
  explicit waits, page objects, Grid setup, and local browser setup to the
  corresponding `thirtyfour` query, waiter, Component, remote-session, and
  managed-session APIs.
- **AI-TRANS-002 (confirmed):** The mdBook must map Playwright locators,
  auto-waiting, and browser-context habits to scoped queries, explicit
  readiness conditions, and isolated WebDriver sessions without implying that
  a cloned `WebDriver` creates a separate browser context.
- **AI-TRANS-003 (confirmed):** The translation guide must explicitly name
  common Selenium and Playwright APIs that `thirtyfour` does not provide and
  show side-by-side source and Rust examples where the mapping benefits from
  code.
- **AI-TRANS-004 (confirmed):** The guide must link to the canonical query,
  waiting, Component, manager, manual WebDriver, and reliable-test guidance and
  be discoverable from the mdBook navigation and AI quickstart.
- **AI-COMP-001 (confirmed):** When the `component` feature is enabled, the
  prelude must export the `Component` derive/trait name and `ElementResolver`
  so the recommended `use thirtyfour::prelude::*;` import supports the common
  Component path.
- **AI-COMP-002 (confirmed):** The `resolve!` and `resolve_present!` helper
  macros must remain explicit crate-root imports. They are optional shorthand,
  and adding generic macro names to the wildcard prelude would introduce
  unnecessary collision risk.
- **AI-COMP-003 (confirmed):** Component rustdoc, mdBook guidance, examples,
  and tests must use the preferred import style and describe its `component`
  feature gate consistently.
- **AI-RUN-001 (confirmed):** The crate must provide one browser-test runner
  that accepts managed and externally created session futures, retains control
  of cleanup, and asynchronously attempts `WebDriver::quit` after the body
  succeeds, returns an error, or unwinds with a panic.
- **AI-RUN-002 (confirmed):** Session setup, body, and cleanup failures must be
  distinguishable. When the body and cleanup both fail, the returned error must
  retain both failures rather than allowing cleanup to replace the test error.
- **AI-RUN-003 (confirmed):** After catching an unwind panic, the runner must
  attempt cleanup and resume the original panic. Documentation must state that
  `panic = "abort"` cannot provide this cleanup guarantee and that a cleanup
  failure or panic during unwind is reported through tracing. It must also
  state that cancelling the runner future can interrupt asynchronous cleanup.
- **AI-RUN-004 (confirmed):** The AI quickstart and reliable-test checklist
  must use the runner as the preferred test shape, while application examples
  may continue to call `quit()` directly.
- **AI-ART-001 (confirmed):** The crate must provide one canonical,
  best-effort failure-artifact collector for current URL, page title,
  screenshot bytes, page source, browser logs, and managed-driver-process logs.
  Failure to capture one field must not prevent attempts for the remaining
  fields.
- **AI-ART-002 (confirmed):** Source and log text must have configurable,
  UTF-8-safe hard bounds with conservative defaults. Log retention must prefer
  the newest entries, and the text report must never print screenshot bytes or
  base64 data.
- **AI-ART-003 (confirmed):** The collector must attach before the failing body
  to observe live managed-driver-process logs and capture before session
  cleanup. Process logs must be documented as potentially containing lines
  from another concurrent session when the manager reuses a process. Browser
  logging capability requirements, unsupported drivers, the `manager` feature
  boundary, and the portable baseline's exclusion of CDP/BiDi-specific
  diagnostics must be explicit.
- **AI-ART-004 (confirmed):** Documentation must warn that bounded artifacts
  can still contain secrets or personal data and require application-specific
  disabling or redaction before external upload.
- **AI-INT-001 (confirmed):** The canonical interaction flow must remain an
  explicit sequence of described query, deliberate cardinality, readiness,
  action, and user-visible outcome.
- **AI-INT-002 (confirmed):** Fresh targets use query readiness filters, while
  intentionally held targets use `wait_until()`. Documentation must define
  clickable as displayed plus enabled rather than a complete interactability
  guarantee.
- **AI-INT-003 (confirmed):** This design adds no selector-taking generic
  click-and-type API. Selector-only helpers would hide cardinality,
  diagnostics, timeout, clearing, stale-element, retry, or outcome semantics,
  while a builder exposing those choices would duplicate `ElementQuery`
  without a stronger safety guarantee. Narrow helpers on an already-resolved
  `WebElement` or `ElementResolver<WebElement>` may compose common operations
  without retrying the operation or waiting for its outcome.
- **AI-INT-004 (confirmed):** Reusable interaction abstractions belong in
  application-specific Component intent methods, where their semantics and
  expected outcome are known.
- **AI-INT-005 (confirmed):** Query absence is evaluated from current matches
  across every selector branch and its filters, without retaining historical
  matches. `not_exists()` returns a boolean when polling ends, while
  `wait_until_gone()` returns a timeout error if matches remain. `nowait()`
  performs one poll. Query absence is distinct from `stale()`, which watches
  one concrete resolved element.
