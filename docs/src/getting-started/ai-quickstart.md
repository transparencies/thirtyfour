# AI/LLM Quickstart

Use this page as the compact source of truth when asking an AI coding tool to
write `thirtyfour` automation. It keeps the reliable defaults in one place and
links to the deeper documentation when a task needs more detail.

## Minimal Setup

```toml
[dependencies]
thirtyfour = "THIRTYFOUR_CRATE_VERSION"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

The default `thirtyfour` features include the local
[`WebDriver::managed`](../features/manager.md) setup used below. Use
[`WebDriver::new` or `WebDriver::builder`](../appendix/manual-webdriver.md)
instead when a remote Selenium or Grid service owns the driver process.
Install Chrome before running the test; the manager downloads a matching
`chromedriver` automatically on first use.

## Starter Test

This example is marked `no_run` because `example.test` represents your
application and cannot be exercised as written.

```rust,no_run
use thirtyfour::prelude::*;

#[tokio::test]
async fn saves_profile_settings() -> WebDriverResult<()> {
    let mut caps = DesiredCapabilities::chrome();
    caps.set_headless()?;
    let driver = WebDriver::managed(caps).await?;

    // Keep the test result so quit() is attempted even when an assertion or
    // browser command fails.
    let test_result: WebDriverResult<()> = async {
        driver.goto("https://example.test/settings").await?;

        let form = driver
            .query(By::Testid("profile-settings"))
            .desc("profile settings form")
            .single()
            .await?;

        form.query(By::Testid("display-name"))
            .desc("display name input")
            .single()
            .await?
            .send_keys("Ada")
            .await?;

        let save_button = form
            .query(By::Testid("save-profile"))
            .desc("save profile button")
            .single()
            .await?;
        save_button.wait_until().clickable().await?;
        save_button.click().await?;

        // Assert the user-visible outcome. This query polls until the saved
        // state appears, so it replaces a brittle fixed sleep.
        driver
            .query(By::Testid("settings-status"))
            .with_text("Saved")
            .and_displayed()
            .desc("saved settings status")
            .single()
            .await?;

        Ok(())
    }
    .await;

    let quit_result = driver.quit().await;
    test_result?;
    quit_result
}
```

## Rules For Generated Automation

- Prefer app-owned `By::Testid` selectors, then stable semantic CSS. Match
  visible text when the copy is the behavior under test; use XPath only when
  CSS cannot reasonably express the target.
- Use `query()` for normal lookup, `.single()` when uniqueness is a page
  contract, and `.desc(...)` on important user-facing elements.
- Never use a fixed sleep for readiness. Poll for the required state with
  `query()` or use `wait_until()` on an element you already have.
- Scope queries through a container or Component, and assert a user-visible
  outcome rather than only checking that a click returned successfully.
- Explicitly quit every session. Do not run independent concurrent flows
  through clones of the same `WebDriver`.

The copyable [Reliable AI-Generated Tests](./reliable-tests.md) checklist is the
review gate for generated code. Apply it before accepting a test.
